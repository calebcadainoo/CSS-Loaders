# CSS-Loaders
This is a collection of css loaders I'll be working on and modifying as time goes on feel free to borrow some inspiration from it

- Loading Bars: 
This is is animation with bars loading. It has it's HTML code in the *index.html* file and the CSS is in the *loader.css*

- Box Drop Animation: 
This is a box falling from invisibility to visibility while scaling. The code is in *boxdrop.html* file
